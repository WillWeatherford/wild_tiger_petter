movement keys are sticky, need to fix


use list of movement keys instead of booleans:


    def event_loop(self):
        """Add/pop directions from player's direction stack as necessary."""
        for event in pg.event.get():
            self.keys = pg.key.get_pressed()
            if event.type == pg.QUIT or self.keys[pg.K_ESCAPE]:
                self.done = True
            elif event.type == pg.KEYDOWN:
                self.player.add_direction(event.key)
            elif event.type == pg.KEYUP:
                self.player.pop_direction(event.key)

    def add_direction(self, key):
        """Add a pressed direction key on the direction stack."""
        if key in DIRECT_DICT:
            if key in self.direction_stack:
                self.direction_stack.remove(key)
            self.direction_stack.append(key)
            self.direction = self.direction_stack[-1]

    def pop_direction(self, key):
        """Pop a released key from the direction stack."""
        if key in DIRECT_DICT:
            if key in self.direction_stack:
                self.direction_stack.remove(key)
            if self.direction_stack:
                self.direction = self.direction_stack[-1]


also use an "old direction" to help with resetting sprites when movign
